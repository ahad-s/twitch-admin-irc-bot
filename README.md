# toBotatoP (aka backward PotatoBot) - IRC Admin bot for twitch.tv
Similar to NightBot/MooBot, this IRC bot responds to people in the chat and can show commands (i.e. !example_command)
Commands are stored locally and can be modified by verified chatters and admin at any time.

Currently PotatoBot only supports text commands :(

# HOW TO USE
Type "!comms" to check out all available commands! 

Type "![command]" to use the command!

Type "!addcom [command_name] [command_text]" to add a new command!

Type "!delcom [command_name]" to delete command!

(in progress) text chat generator for emulating chat as if it were another popular channel, built using an encoder-decoder RNN model in TensorFlow
